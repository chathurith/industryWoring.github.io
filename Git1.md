# What is the Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast
performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce,
and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient
staging areas, and multiple workflows.

# What is the Sub Version

Subversion is a free/open source version control system (VCS). 
That is, Subversion manages files and directories, and the changes made to them, over time. 
This allows you to recover older versions of your data or examine the history of how your data changed.

Subversion can operate across networks, which allows it to be used by people on different computers.
At some level, the ability for various people to modify and manage the same set of data from their respective locations fosters collaboration.
Progress can occur more quickly without a single conduit through which all modifications must occur.
And because the work is versioned, you need not fear that quality is the trade-off for losing that conduitâ€”if some incorrect change is made to the data, just undo that change.
